# JobCatcher

JobCatcher is a daemon that retrieves job offers from multiple job boards feeds
and generates custom RSS feeds and HTML reports for you. This is a decentralized
software meant to run of your own server.

JobCatcher comes with a filter feature, so you can filter company names with
black or whitelists.

Think of it as a RSS feed reader with filter feature.

This software is under GPLv2 License.

## Work in Progress

The project is fully in development and many features need to be implemented.
It is developed in Python. This is my first time I use Python on a non-basic
project. So I guess my code is not so pythonic ... yet. Feel free to help me or
show me mistakes I could have made or improvements I could do.

# List of supported Job Boards

- Apec.fr (French)
- Lolix.org (French) TODO
- Linux.com (English) TODO

Help me to add new job boards to JobCatcher ! :)
